HMR_8422	1-alkyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate is the same as alkyl-glycerone-3-phosphate, so it will be replaced with the latter. After this replacement, the reaction is identical to HMR_7596, so it should be DELETED.	HMR_7596
HMR_8423	1-alkyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate is the same as alkyl-glycerone-3-phosphate, so it will be replaced with the latter. After replacement, this reaction is imbalanced and does not make sense, so it should be DELETED.

PMI1346PHn	after rebalancing, reaction is identical to HMR_8836	HMR_8836
HMR_8301	reaction is imbalanced and the process is captured in other reactions properly, so this reaction should be DELETED.	
HMR_8274	reaction treats mass of glycolipid differently than other reactions, and should therefore be DELETED.	
HMR_6499	correct version of reaction is HMR_6500	HMR_6500

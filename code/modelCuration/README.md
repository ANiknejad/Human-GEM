# Model curation scripts

This directory contains curation-related scripts and functions used to make changes to the Human-GEM model. These model curation scripts help to improve transparency of changes made to the model when the number of changes is too large to view practically.

Note that all code in this directory is considered deprecated and will not be updated or maintained.

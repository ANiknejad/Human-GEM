# Model curation scripts

This directory contains curation-related scripts and functions used to make changes to the Human-GEM repository. These curation scripts help to improve transparency of changes made to the model when the number of changes is too large to view practically.

- `addMAMetIDs.m` and `completeMARxnids.m` are scripts for adding metabolite and reaction identifiers (#174) that are to be used for Met Atlas web-portal.

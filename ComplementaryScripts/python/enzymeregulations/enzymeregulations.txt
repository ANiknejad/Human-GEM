[][ENZYME REGULATION: The heterotetramer and the heterodimer composed of IDH3A and IDH3G subunits can be allosterically activated by citrate (CIT) or/and ADP, and the two activators can act independently or synergistically. The heterodimer composed of IDH3A and IDH3B subunits cannot be allosterically regulated and the allosteric regulation of the heterotetramer is through the IDH3G subunit and not the IDH3B subunit. The IDH3G subunit contains the allosteric site which consists of a CIT-binding site and an ADP-binding site, and the binding of CIT and ADP causes conformational changes at the allosteric site which are transmitted to the active site in the catalytic subunit (IDH3A) through a cascade of conformational changes at the heterodimer interface, leading to stabilization of the isocitrate-binding at the active site and thus activation of the enzyme. ATP can activate the heterotetramer and the heterodimer composed of IDH3A and IDH3G subunits at low concentrations but inhibits their activities at high concentrations, whereas ATP exhibits only inhibitory effect on the heterodimer composed of IDH3A and IDH3B subunits. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28098230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28139779}.], [], [], [], [ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin. {ECO:0000250}.], [], [], [], [], [], []

[], [], [], [ENZYME REGULATION: Regulated by alteration of quaternary structure. Exhibits burst rates of DNA synthesis are about 5 times faster in the presence of POLD4 (Pol-delta4 complex) than in its absence (Pol-delta3 complex), while the affinity of the enzyme for its DNA and dNTP substrates appears unchanged. The Pol-delta3 complex is more likely to proofread DNA synthesis because it cleaves single-stranded DNA twice as fast and transfers mismatched DNA from the polymerase to the exonuclease sites 9 times faster compared to the Pol-delta3 complex. Pol-delta3 also extends mismatched primers 3 times more slowly in the absence of POLD4. The conversion of Pol-delta4 into Pol-delta3 is induced by genotoxic stress or by replication stress leading POLD4 degradation (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433).

Ras-GTP recruits RAF1 to the membrane, thereby promoting its activation. The inactive conformation of RAF1 is maintained by autoinhibitory interactions occurring between the N-terminal regulatory and the C-terminal catalytic domains and by the binding of a 14-3-3 protein that contacts two phosphorylation sites, Ser-259 and Ser-621. Upon mitogenic stimulation, Ras and PPP2R1A cooperate to release autoinhibition and the subsequent phosphorylation of activating sites: Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491, and Ser-494, yields a fully active kinase. Through a negative feedback mechanism involving MAPK1/ERK2, RAF1 is phosphorylated on Ser-29, Ser-43, Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301 and Ser-642 by MAPK1/ERK2, which yields an inactive, desensitized kinase.

Activated by homodimerization and heterodimerization (with BRAF). Also regulated through association with other proteins such as KSR2, CNKSR1/CNK1, PEBP1/RKIP, PHB/prohibitin and SPRY4. PEBP1/RKIP acts by dissociating RAF1 from its substrates MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. PHB/prohibitin facilitates the displacement of 14-3-3 from RAF1 by activated Ras, thereby promoting cell membrane localization and phosphorylation of RAF1 at the activating Ser-338.

# Human-GEM data

This directory contains datasets, other GEMs, and log files that support some functionality of Human-GEM and its associated scripts, and/or were used for the generation and curation of Human-GEM. The data subdirectories and their contents are briefly summarized below.

### BiGG
Scripts for the retrieval and processing of metabolite and reaction BiGG IDs, as well as resulting Matlab datafiles. The contents of this directory were used during the curation of Human-GEM, but are now deprecated.

### Ensembl
Contains the Ensembl identifier mapping file, `ensembl_ID_mapping.tsv`, used to translate between different types of gene, protein, and transcript IDs (ENSG, ENSP, ENST, gene symbols, UniProt, NCBI).

### HepatoNet1
Contains the HepatoNet1 GEM (`HepatoNet1.mat`). This GEM was used for reference purposes during Human-GEM development, but is not used by any current functions and can be considered deprecated.

### HMR2








### io
Functions associated with input/output of files into and out of MATLAB, such as the yaml-formatted Human-GEM, or documentation of model changes.

### misc
Code used for technical purposes, typically to augment missing or inconvenient functionalities of MATLAB.

### modelCuration
Contains curation-related scripts and functions that were used to make changes to the Human-GEM model. These model curation scripts help to improve clarity of what changes were made to the model when the number of changes is too large to view practically, or when the changes were made directly to the Human-GEM `.mat` file (done before implementing the `.yml` workflow). Their only remaining purpose is for transparency and re-tracing the steps of the curation process.

Note that all code in this directory is considered deprecated and will not be updated with later versions of Human-GEM.

### qc
Functions to help with quality control (QC) of Human-GEM, such as checking for duplicate reactions or mass imbalances.

### tINIT
Functions associated with the **t**ask‚Äêdriven **I**ntegrative **N**etwork **I**nference for **T**issues (tINIT) algorithm. These functions include updates to the [original algorithm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646661), as described in the [Human-GEM publication](https://stke.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scisignal.aaz1482). Note that the updated tINIT implementation included here still requires many functions from the [RAVEN Toolbox 2](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN).

### test
Functions for testing purposes
